DJI Tello Drone Control With An Android App

Drone Programming With Python 2023
UNILAG DESIGN STUDIO

<b>APPRECIATION</b>
<p>My gratitude goes to Engr. Williams Baah, UNILAG DESIGN STUDIO, for putting together this opportunity to learn and apply what we were taught. This has laid a foundation, upon which i can practically build other programming and robotics concepts</p>

<b>Project Description</b>
<p>I, Adewole Benard, a 500-level student of the Department of Systems Engineering, University of Lagos, as a participant in the "Drone programming with Python" program developed a drone controlling app as a capstone project.</p>
<p>This report presents the design and development of a drone-controlling app that allows users to control their drones remotely through a mobile device. The app was developed with a user-friendly interface and is compatible with both iOS and Android platforms. The app's features include live video streaming, flight control, and telemetry data display. The project is called Skysteer</p>

<b>Design And Development</b>
<p>The application will be built with C# programming language, in the MAUI .NET platform. Using this technology, the app has the ability to be cross-platform. That is, it can run on Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. But I will streamline this to just Android and iOS, seeing that these devices are as portable and handy as a game controller
The drone-controlling app was designed with simplicity and user experience in mind. The app's interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, with large buttons for controlling the drone's movement</p>

<b>Work Done</b>
<p>The application in the development phase has the following capabilities </p>
<ul>
  <li>Take off</li>
  <li>Land</li>
  <li>Steer: left, right, forward, and backward</li>
  <li>Yaw</li>
  <li>Measure battery level at intervals</li>
</ul>


Screenshots of the app are shown below.

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>The drone-controlling app offers a simple and effective way for users to control their drones. With its user-friendly interface and robust safety features, the app provides users with the peace of mind that comes from knowing that their drone is under control. The app's compatibility with both iOS and Android platforms makes it accessible to a wide range of users, and its live video streaming and telemetry data features allow users to fully understand and control their drones. Overall, the drone controlling app represents a major step forward in the field of drone technology and provides a valuable tool for drone enthusiasts and professionals alike.</p>
